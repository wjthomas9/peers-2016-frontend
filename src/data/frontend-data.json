This is experimental right now, we haven't gone too crazy yet, though we've seen some pretty interesting gains as far as page render time goes. \n\nA little background on our team:\n\nWe have three senior-level front-end devs that deal with all major project builds, client training and major maintenance projects. Also we have one junior-level front-end guy who handles ongoing support, other maintenance, and small projects.\n\nTypically there is only one front-end developer assigned to any given project and there could be one to three back-end developers alongside a graphic designer, project manager, ux designer, and art director on any project team. We also have an in-house SEO specialist who helps out with content on occasion.\n\nWe're able to dedicate nearly all our billable time to front-end development, which is great.\n\nOver the past year we've come up with a \"starter template\" git repo where we maintain our main gulp file and base skeleton files, with branches for including other things like Foundation, Bourbon or any other 3rd party tools we use regularly. We also develop for several content management platforms too, so we have to keep things pretty simplified since our development needs change depending on the platform.","Give me a short quote that sums up the biggest value that you believe having a frontend build process brings to your design and development efforts.":"Without a build process we'd still be writing vanilla css.","Passionate about this topic?

It's so so soooooo nice to be able to hop over to another project, copy the module, modify it as necessary, and drop it into place.
