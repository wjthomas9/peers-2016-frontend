- Javascript (lint, concat, minify)
- Styles (lint, compile scss, vendor prefix, minify)
- Images (optimize and sync files between /src and /dist asset folders)

In addition, we have a browsersync task to keep things updated in the browser automatically.

Also, our scripts and styles tasks both use gulp-notify to display notifications of errors and successful tasks.

We set a --dev flag when we run our gulp task which will either enable or disable file compression, minification, and sourcemap generation depending on what we're needing to do.

Lately we've also been experimenting with Penthouse to render out critical css into it's own code block and inject it into the head of our page templates, for performance boosts. This is experimental right now, we haven't gone too crazy yet, though we've seen some pretty interesting gains as far as page render time goes. 

A little background on our team:

We have three senior-level front-end devs that deal with all major project builds, client training and major maintenance projects. Also we have one junior-level front-end guy who handles ongoing support, other maintenance, and small projects.

Typically there is only one front-end developer assigned to any given project and there could be one to three back-end developers alongside a graphic designer, project manager, ux designer, and art director on any project team. We also have an in-house SEO specialist who helps out with content on occasion.

We're able to dedicate nearly all our billable time to front-end development, which is great.

Over the past year we've come up with a ""starter template"" git repo where we maintain our main gulp file and base skeleton files, with branches for including other things like Foundation, Bourbon or any other 3rd party tools we use regularly. We also develop for several content management platforms too, so we have to keep things pretty simplified since our development needs change depending on the platform.",Without a build process we'd still be writing vanilla css.,"As I said earlier, we're experimenting with rendering critical css using pocketjoso's Penthouse node module in our gulp file. https://github.com/pocketjoso/penthouse

Essentially we build and compile our scss files like normal, and then Penhouse renders the page on its own, determines where the ""fold"" is, figures out what styles are needed from our main.min.css, and then spits that style block out into a file we're including as an embedded style block in our DOM head.

We've seen Google's PageSpeed score jump substantially (15-20 points or more) with this technique. Though, we're not exactly how it's going to impact things on a production server vs our development server.",dantrewartha@gmail.com

I do it all!),"I primarily handle frontend development, collaborating with designers to help bring their vision to life.",Large marketing or informational websites,They're a regular part of our design and development workflow.,"I use Gulp on all of my projects. Having a modern workflow in place makes it much easier to stay on top of best practicesâ€”which, as best as I'm able, allows me to build things the ""right"" way. It also brings a boatload of efficiency to my work, and who doesn't love that.  

And it's not uncommon for me to bolt on to a larger team as part of a project. Understanding how modern build processes work is typically a critical piece of that collaboration. In that way, it opens me up for more and better project opportunities. ","On a day to day basis the biggest value it brings, by far, is modularity. This helps make my projects more organized, scalable and maintainable.","The modularity mentioned above also means that the components can be shared from one project to the next (especially if you're using a BEM approach with your CSS and some kind of module pattern with your JS). 

I'll often find myself in a situation where a new project needs a bit of functionality that's 85% similar to one from a previous project. It's so so soooooo nice to be able to hop over to another project, copy the module, modify it as necessary, and drop it into place. It can save countless hours and is fairly straightforward when your CSS and JS are nicely encapsulated.

In a way your project archive becomes a massive component library to pick and choose from.",bburwell@thisisstatic.com
